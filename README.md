# fandango
KW Begin with a folder structure printout (to see the directory structure) for a new platform named “fandango”, an adaptive, rust and python written, quantization runtime with the following dependencies: Quantized Model Loader (GGUF, safetensors, etc), Precision Aware Graph Compiler (IR/DAG), Fused Attention Kernels (sparse+ INT4/INT8), a runtime scheduler (token aware and SLA driven), and a Quantization Aware KVCache manager. Take a k8s native app route.     Based on the requirements for the "fandango" platform—an adaptive, Rust and Python-written quantization runtime with the specified components and a Kubernetes (k8s) native app approach
